										The history of Argentine wine dates back to the 16th century and the time of the Spanish conquest. The first vines were planted at that time from stock brought on ships from Spain and were the mainstay until noble European varieties were introduced in the mid-19th century. Economic changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to technological advances and encouraged new national and international investors to enter the scene, ultimately shifting the course of Argentine wine and bringing it firmly into the global market.
										Argentina has developed an extraordinary wine industry over the past 30 years, and its wide range of altitudes and climate conditions, the local know-how, new technologies and a deeply rooted popular wine culture lends Argentine wines their unique identity.
