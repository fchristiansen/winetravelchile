							<h4>testimonial</h4>
							<p>“Thank you so much for showing us part of the wonderful wine country of Chile. Each vineyard was very special in different ways, and we will never forget our first lunch at Altair, our time at Lapostolle and Matetic and our very special visit to the Harvest Festival in Santa Cruz. Thank you for taking us to the dances! We greatly appreciate your patience and sense of humor with our group. You made this visit very special for us and we will never forget it”</p>
