											“As the mayor of San Francisco and a private citizen, I have had an opportunity to
											travel to many wonderful countries…but our trip to Argentina and Chile this year
											 has become one of the best ever. Your expert guidance and assistance with every
											  phase was invaluable. Every day’s events and activities felt like they were
											  specific to our particular interests and not part of a conventional “package.” And the food and wine
											  were magnificent in city neighborhoods and out in the countryside. The personnel you select
											  ed as guides and drivers at each location were obviously well informed as well as most trust
											  worthy. When the spouse of our companion couple was taken ill and required hospital treatment,
											  you and our guides were with us every step of the way like family. We will be back soon!”
